# RisuAI Migration Guide

There are three ways to migrate data from an existing RisuAI installation (Web RisuAI, Local RisuAI) to 小酒馆. Choose based on your source environment and data size.

- [1. Local Backup File (.bin)](#1-local-backup-file-bin) — Works in all environments. The most common method.
- [2. Save Folder Zip Upload](#2-save-folder-zip-upload) — Local RisuAI, small datasets.
- [3. Save Folder Direct Copy](#3-save-folder-direct-copy) — Local RisuAI, large datasets.


## Before You Start

> ⚠️ **Back up your existing data** before migrating. You can export a `.bin` file from RisuAI's Settings > Backup.


---

## 1. Local Backup File (.bin)

Export a `.bin` backup file from existing RisuAI, then import it into 小酒馆. Works regardless of the source environment (web / Tauri / Capacitor / local).

1. **In existing RisuAI**: Settings > Backup > "Save Local Backup" to export a `.bin` file.
2. **In 小酒馆**: Settings > Data Migration > "Import Original Risu Local Backup" to import the `.bin` file.

## 2. Save Folder Zip Upload

If you were using Local RisuAI (the Node server version), you can zip your `save` folder and upload it.

1. Compress the `save` folder of your existing RisuAI project as a zip file.
2. In 小酒馆, go to Settings > Data Migration > "Import save folder from NodeOnly Risu" accordion.
3. Upload the zip via "Import from Save Folder (Zip Upload)".

> If the zip file is too large, the upload may fail. In that case, use [3. Save Folder Direct Copy](#3-save-folder-direct-copy).


---

## 3. Save Folder Direct Copy

Suitable for large datasets (several GB or more). Requires direct filesystem access to the server.

1. Stop the 小酒馆 server.
2. Overwrite 小酒馆's `save` folder with the existing RisuAI's `save` folder.
3. Restart the 小酒馆 server — automatic migration begins.
    - Monitor progress in the terminal or PM2 logs.
4. After migration completes, use Settings > Data Migration > "Import save folder from NodeOnly Risu" accordion > "Clean Up Migrated Save Files" to remove the original files and reclaim disk space.
