# Remote Access Guide

There are two ways to access 小酒馆 running on your PC from another device (smartphone, tablet, another PC).

- [1. Quick Tunnel](#1-quick-tunnel) — Built into 小酒馆. No additional app required. URL changes on server restart.
- [2. Tailscale](#2-tailscale) — Based on a private network (VPN). Persistent URL.


## 1. Quick Tunnel

A built-in feature of 小酒馆 that issues a temporary remote access URL.

1. On your PC, in 小酒馆: Settings > Remote Access > "Open Remote Access"
2. Scan the displayed QR code with your smartphone camera, or enter the URL directly in another device's browser.

> The URL changes whenever the server restarts. For a persistent URL, use [Tailscale](#2-tailscale).

## 2. Tailscale

Builds a private network (VPN) accessible only from devices logged in with the same account. The URL persists across server restarts.

### Step 1: Install Tailscale

- PC: [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com/)
- Smartphone: Search for "Tailscale" in App Store / Google Play
- Other PC: Same — [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com/)

### Step 2: Sign in with the same account

Sign into the Tailscale app on the PC and on every device you'll access from, using the same account (Google, Microsoft, etc.).

### Step 3: Enable HTTPS sharing on the PC

In the terminal on the PC running 小酒馆, run once:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg http://localhost:6001
```

### Step 4: Access from another device

Open in a browser using this URL format:

```
https://your-pc-name.tail-something.ts.net
```

Find the exact address from your PC's entry in the Tailscale app's device list. Bookmark it in the browser, and from then on you only need to start the server on the PC to access from any device.
